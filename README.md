# WordleBot
Helps you beat wordle game!
The bot gives you the most probable word. You can use that prediction or make a guess on your own. It uses the result from one turn to restrict the search space.
The result to be entered must be a 5-character string where each character will be one of **0** (not a match - Grey), **1** (partial match - Yellow) or **2** (complete match - Green).

**To run:**
```
python wordleBot.py
```
